**X-Originating-IP** - The IP address of the email was sent from (this is known as an X-header)
**Smtp.mailfrom/header.from** - The domain the email was sent from (these headers are within Authentication-Results)
**Reply-To** - This is the email address a reply email will be sent to instead of the From email addres
### **Characteristics phishing emails have in common:**
1. The sender email name/address will masquerade as a trusted entity (email spoofing)
2. The email subject line and/or body (text) is written with a sense of urgency or uses certain keywords such as Invoice, Suspended, etc. 
3. The email body (HTML) is designed to match a trusting entity (such as Amazon)
4. The email body (HTML) is poorly formatted or written (contrary from the previous point)
5. The email body uses generic content, such as Dear Sir/Madam. 
6. Hyperlinks (oftentimes uses URL shortening services to hide its true origin)
7. A malicious attachment posing as a legitimate document
